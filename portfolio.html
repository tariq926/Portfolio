                <h3>Familiar Programming Languages</h3>
                <div class="Programming Language">
                        <p>Since I'm a student taking diploma in Information Communication Technology, I'm familiar with some of the programming languages which include:<br><br>
                            <h4>Psuedocode:-</h4> Though it is not used nowadays, this was the first language I was taught in school it seemed to be easy though and i loved it.<br>
                            <h4>Pascal:-</h4> This was the second programming language to be taught.<br> Pascal language is not also used nowadays, but still i was taught this at school.<br> This also seemed to have laid a faundation in my journey in the programming world.<br>
                            <h4>C:-</h4> This was the third programming language to be taught and to know about in my journey as a programmer.<br> I have some skills for this language I can programme with it.<br>
                            <h4>C+:-</h4> This was the fourth programming language to be taught.<br> Though i'm still learning more about the language as i just know of the basics, let's say that I just have the basic skills for this language.<br>
                            <h4>C++:-</h4>My Lecture back at Embu has started teaching me this programming language in the lectures.<br> The language is quite interesting as it is not that much complexed.<br>
                            <h4>HTML:-</h4> Currently I'm studdying html at power learn project academy, and i have the basic skills as the instructors have laid a good foundation for the programming language.<br>
                            <h4>CSS:-</h4> I've also learnt styling with css as it is used for styling websites.<br> And basically i'm still finding my way around the programming language, hopefully i will master it in the near comming future.<br>
